# Rastre Analysis

This notebook performs analysis and visualization on raster data related to the **MPO project**. The analysis focuses on handling and visualizing spatial data, specifically in the context of raster-based flood maps, velocities, and directions.

## Features

- Load and analyze raster data using Python.
- Perform spatial operations and visualizations.
- Applicable to flood mapping and related geospatial analysis.

## Requirements

- Jupyter Notebook
- Python 3.x with the following libraries:
  - `arcpy`
  - `rasterio`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `numpy`

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the notebook `rastre_mpo2.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
3. Set the required paths and data inputs.
4. Run the cells to perform raster analysis and visualize results.

```bash
